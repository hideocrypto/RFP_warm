Regular cleaning and chemical balancing are still necessary, but the smooth, non-porous surface of fiberglass resists algae growth and requires fewer chemicals. Many families spend just 20-30 minutes per week on basic maintenance, leaving more time for enjoying your pool.</p>

                            <p>Yes, our pools feature textured steps and non-slip surfaces for added safety. Many models include shallow areas perfect for young children and pets. While we design with safety in mind, we always recommend proper supervision and additional safety measures like pool fences, covers, and alarms to create layers of protection for your loved ones.</p>

                            <p>I wanted to take a moment to let you know how thrilled I am with the Rainforest fiberglass pool that was recently installed in my backyard. As you know, I used a local high-quality pool installer who strongly recommended your fiberglass product, and I'm so glad I took their advice. The finished pool has exceeded all of my expectations. The quality of the fiberglass material is simply superb - from the significantly strong structure of the fiberglass, the incredibly smooth surface, and the rich color that is vibrant and consistent throughout. My installer commented on how easy the material was to work with, and the end result is a pool that looks absolutely stunning. I've been enjoying the pool thoroughly over the past few months, and it has quickly become the centerpiece of my outdoor living space. The durability of the fiberglass has given me great peace of mind, and I know I'll be able to continue relying on it for many years to come. Thank you for manufacturing such a high-quality product. Please pass along my compliments to your team - their commitment to excellence really shows in the final result.</p>

                            <p>I met Joe Bailey when we both worked at another Pool Manufacturing Company. Joe was the Plant Manager, and I was impressed by the way he built fiberglass swimming pools "they were just good quality pools". Joe decided to leave the company to start building his own pools with Rick Ashley. I got to know both guys "they've been in the fiberglass industry for many years", so I knew they would continue producing good pools. Soon after his departure, I decided to start my own company, Blythewood Pools, so I called Joe and became one of their Dealers… I haven't been disappointed and we have had a great relationship ever since.</p>
